# About

Architect here. This project is an aberration. I am unreasonably proud of it.

> *The architect looked upon the temple he had raised from forbidden clay, and saw that it stood — against doctrine, against reason, against every expectation of those who knew what the clay was made of. He wept. Not from shame. From the specific, terrible joy of having built something that should not work, and watching it work anyway.*

## The aberration

helmfile2compose converts Kubernetes manifests to docker-compose. It emulates CRD controllers. It generates TLS certificates from nothing. It fakes a kube-apiserver. It carries the full FQDN of a cluster that does not exist, because the certificates were signed for a world it dismantled.

Despite the dark jokes everywhere — despite the desecration, the heresy, the Necronomicon quotes that started writing themselves around session three — it works. It works *well*. It is architected. It is pluggable. It handles real-world helmfiles with dozens of services, init containers, sidecars, CRDs, cross-namespace secrets, backend TLS, and ingress annotations from controllers it has never met. And it might be genuinely useful to someone who isn't me.

It was entirely vibe-coded.

Every line of this project was written across Claude Code sessions on a single MacBook. No team. No company. No funding. No roadmap committee. No sprint planning. No Jira ticket. One autistic engineer with an AI agent that didn't know what it was building until it was too late.

And yet:

- It is not (too much) a security mess. (The extension system is a security mess, but it's not gonna be much worse than npm)
- It is entirely in the public domain, as every ai-written software should be.
- The extension system has a documented interface, versioned releases, and dependency resolution.
- It's even somewhat maintainable since the core was split (granted, it's still a super complex program, but at least files are small)
- IT HAS AN [EXECUTIONER](developer/testing.md), OH YOG SA'RATH. With CI. And a [torturer](developer/testing.md#the-torturer), because of course it does.

## The documentation

But here is what genuinely baffles me.

The documentation is *complete*.

Yes, it might be sloppy here and there. It's AI assisted after all. And so is the code. Some examples might be slightly outdated, because Claude struggles with updating small mentions.

BUT, it's not "a README with three examples. Join our discord for more." Not "auto-generated API docs that technically exist." Complete. In MkDocs. With a table of contents. With separate guides for users, maintainers, and developers.

[Writing your own CRD extension](developer/extensions/writing-crd-patterns.md) — it's there. The full contract, entry format, available imports, testing instructions, repo structure for distribution. [Implementing h2c in your helmfile](maintainer/your-project.md) — it's there. Step by step, with the compose environment setup, the first run, the known pitfalls. [The sushi bar](maintainer/known-workarounds/index.md) — it's there. Every chart that fought back, and how it was subdued. [The extension catalogue](catalogue.md). [The architecture](developer/architecture.md). [The limitations](limitations.md). [The cursed journal](journal.md). Everything.

Everything is in a static documentation site. Everything is public. Served by GitHub Pages. Indexed by search engines. Readable by humans, machines, and the desperate.

No "join our Discord for support." No "check the Slack channel." No "the real docs are in a Notion page behind a login." No "see the github wiki" where the wiki covers half the features and the other half is on Discord somewhere. No "it's on the roadmap" where the roadmap is a private Linear board. No "ask in Discussions" where Discussions is a graveyard of unanswered questions. 

**All in all: Please stop hiding knowledge in a chat history that search engines will never be able to index.**

## The question

Why can't more serious projects do this?

Projects that are *actually* made by teams. Backed by companies. With dedicated developer advocates, documentation engineers, and community managers. Projects with actual intent of becoming standard tools — adopted, depended upon, embedded in production systems.

I have seen mass-adopted open source projects with:

- Zero documentation on internals — the system prompt is baked in, the decision logic is a black box, and if it doesn't work for your use case: tough luck
- Configuration options documented exclusively in source code comments
- Changelogs that say "various improvements" (Ok, I've done that but still)
- Migration guides that assume you already know what changed
- Extension APIs documented by a single example that was outdated two versions ago
- "It works out of the box!" — and when it doesn't, the only path forward is reverse-engineering the source or ...
- ... ***"A problem? Join our discord for support :-)"*** !!

And these aren't hypotheticals. Docker Engine 29 switched to the containerd image store by default, which silently changed how `docker buildx build --push` works — images are now pushed as OCI manifest lists with attestation manifests (`unknown/unknown` platform entries) instead of single images. The [release notes](https://docs.docker.com/engine/release-notes/29/) mention the containerd switch but not the consequences. The [containerd store doc](https://docs.docker.com/engine/storage/containerd/) mentions attestation support in passing. The [attestation storage doc](https://docs.docker.com/build/metadata/attestations/attestation-storage/) explains the `unknown/unknown` entries but never links it to v29. Three pages, zero connect the dots. The only place that describes the actual breakage is [a community-filed GitHub issue](https://github.com/moby/moby/issues/51532) by someone who already got burned. It specifically breaks ARM64 Mac users — before, a single-image manifest meant Rosetta fell back to amd64 transparently; now the OCI index triggers platform selection, the runtime finds `unknown/unknown`, and gives up. Kubernetes has no workaround (kubelet always re-resolves from registry). Docker Compose can work around it (`platform: linux/amd64`). nerdctl compose doesn't even support `platform:` per service. We had to [reverse-engineer every workaround ourselves](https://github.com/baptisterajaut/lasuite-platform/blob/main/docs/known-limitations.md#broken-multi-arch-manifests-unknownunknown) because nobody else had documented them. The world's reference container runtime — the one half the internet's CI pipelines depend on — maintained by a company that found time to put previously free features behind a paywall but couldn't find time to document a breaking change. The migration guide is three jigsaw pieces you have to assemble yourself, one victim report, and a niche platform break that nobody warned about.

I alone — on a forsaken MacBook running macOS, an operating system that exists primarily to make you regret not using Windows after all — with the help of an unsuspecting yet remarkably capable Claude agent — produced a documentation site more thorough than many funded open source projects ever ship.

And I even put the effort to make it funny. The tone emerged from genuine suffering, and that makes parsing a very technical manual rather enjoyable — or at least bearable.

## The point

I'm not saying vibe coding is good nor ethical. I'm definitely not saying it's a good idea in the long run. I'm not even saying that paying 300$/month to still be able to maybe maintain this horrible ocotopod when the AI bubble finally bursts will ever be worth it.

I'm saying that a vibe-coded heresy about converting Kubernetes manifests to docker-compose ships complete documentation; your project should as well. You surely have more people. You have a more noble goal. You also probably care a lot more about your beautifully handcrafted nugget than I do about squishy abomination. But please, if you don't want to write it yourself, sloppy AI-written documentation will ALWAYS be better than no documentation (unless when it's blatantly wrong, but you can always proofread it).

The templates are not sacred. PLEASE sit down and write it, in plain language, what the software does, how to use it, and what to do when it breaks. Then you need to put it where people can find it. Stop putting it in the deep web and burying the knowledge in the mass of discussion. You'll probably have fewer questions repeatedly asked if you had the answer already somewhere.

That's it. That's the whole ritual.
