# Build system

> *The scribe's first task was not to write the scripture — it was to build the press. For the scripture was twenty-one tablets, and the faithful demanded a single scroll. The press crushes the tablets in order, strips the seams, and produces a scroll indistinguishable from one carved by hand. The scribe keeps both. The faithful see only the scroll. The inquisitors see everything.*

## Two scripts, two purposes

### `build.py` (in h2c-core)

Concatenates `src/h2c/` into a single `h2c.py`. This is the bare engine — no extensions, no built-in converters, empty registries. Used to produce the h2c-core release artifact.

```bash
cd h2c-core && python build.py
# → h2c.py
```

### `build-distribution.py` (in h2c-core, shipped as release asset)

Builds a distribution from core + extensions directory. Used by distribution repos (e.g. [helmfile2compose](https://github.com/helmfile2compose/helmfile2compose)) to produce a single-file script with built-in extensions.

```bash
# Local dev mode
cd helmfile2compose && python ../h2c-core/build-distribution.py helmfile2compose \
  --extensions-dir extensions --core-dir ../h2c-core
# → helmfile2compose.py

# CI mode (fetches h2c.py from GitHub release)
python build-distribution.py helmfile2compose --extensions-dir extensions
# → helmfile2compose.py
```

## How concatenation works

Both scripts follow the same core pattern:

1. **Module order**: Modules are concatenated in dependency order — `MODULES` (in `build.py`) / `CORE_MODULES` (in `build-distribution.py`). This list is manually maintained. If the order is wrong, the smoke test fails immediately.

2. **Internal imports stripped**: All `from h2c.*` imports are removed — everything's in one namespace after concatenation. Multi-line internal imports (parenthesized continuation) are handled.

3. **Stdlib/third-party imports deduplicated**: All `import` and `from ... import` statements are collected, deduplicated by text, and sorted (stdlib first, `yaml` second).

4. **Module docstrings stripped**: Triple-quoted docstrings at the top of each module are removed.

5. **Section comments**: Each module boundary is marked with `# --- core.env ---` (or similar) in the output for navigation.

6. **Smoke test**: After writing the output, both scripts run `python <output> --help` and fail if it exits non-zero.

## `build-distribution.py` specifics

### Two modes

- **`--core-dir` (local dev)**: Reads core sources from a local h2c-core checkout. Processes each module in `CORE_MODULES` order, exactly like `build.py`.
- **CI (no `--core-dir`)**: Fetches the flat `h2c.py` from the latest (or pinned) h2c-core GitHub release. Strips its `__main__` guard, parses the already-concatenated imports + body, then appends extensions on top.

### Extension discovery

Extensions are discovered from `--extensions-dir`: all `.py` files except `__init__.py` and hidden/underscore-prefixed files. Each is processed the same way as core modules (strip internal imports, collect stdlib imports, extract body).

### Post-concatenation steps

After all code (core + extensions):

1. **`_auto_register()` call** — appended to populate converter/rewriter/transform registries from all classes in globals
2. **`sys.modules` hack** — registers the flat file as the `h2c` module so runtime-loaded extensions can `from h2c import ...`
3. **`__main__` guard** — `if __name__ == "__main__": main()`

## The `sys.modules` hack

Why it exists:

- When the output file is `h2c.py`, Python finds it natively as the `h2c` module. No hack needed. That's `build.py`.
- When the output file is `helmfile2compose.py` (or any other name), `from h2c import ...` fails because no `h2c` module exists on the import path.

The hack creates a fake module in `sys.modules`:

```python
import types as _types
sys.modules.setdefault("h2c", _types.ModuleType("h2c"))
sys.modules["h2c"].__dict__.update(
    {k: v for k, v in globals().items() if not k.startswith("_")}
)
```

This only matters for **runtime-loaded** extensions (via `--extensions-dir`). Built-in extensions (concatenated at build time) don't import at all — they're already in the same namespace.

## Gotchas

### 1. Artifact shadowing

If `h2c.py` (build artifact) exists in the current directory while running `PYTHONPATH=src python -m h2c`, Python finds the flat file instead of the package. Error: `'h2c' is not a package`.

**Fix:** Delete the artifact, or don't build in the same directory you develop from.

### 2. Module order matters

`CORE_MODULES` must be topological. A function defined in `core/env.py` that uses something from `pacts/helpers.py` requires `pacts/helpers.py` to appear earlier in the list. The smoke test catches this immediately — if the order is wrong, `--help` crashes on a `NameError`.

### 3. Third-party detection is naive

The import sorter checks `module == "yaml"` to identify third-party packages. If a new third-party dependency is added, update this check in both build scripts. Currently only `pyyaml` exists as a third-party dep.

### 4. `_auto_register()` skips base classes and `_`-prefixed names

If you name an extension class `_MyConverter`, it won't be registered. If you create a new base class, add it to `_BASE_CLASSES` in `core/convert.py`.

### 5. Duplicate kind detection is fatal

`_auto_register()` calls `sys.exit(1)` if two classes claim the same kind. This is intentional — silent conflicts are worse. If you see:

```
Error: kind 'Ingress' claimed by both CaddyProvider and MyIngressProvider
```

...one of them needs to go. A distribution can only have one handler per kind.

## Running locally

```bash
# Build bare core
cd h2c-core && python build.py
# → h2c.py

# Build distribution (local dev)
cd helmfile2compose && python ../h2c-core/build-distribution.py helmfile2compose \
  --extensions-dir extensions --core-dir ../h2c-core
# → helmfile2compose.py

# Build distribution (CI mode, fetches from release)
python build-distribution.py helmfile2compose --extensions-dir extensions
```
