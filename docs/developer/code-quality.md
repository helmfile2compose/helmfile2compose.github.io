# Code quality

This should not score well. A project born from desecration, vibe-coded across multiple sessions of questionable mental health, whose primary architectural document is a fake Lovecraftian grimoire — this project has no business passing a linter. And yet.

## Tools

All repos use the same toolchain:

- **[pylint](https://pylint.readthedocs.io/)** — static analysis. Style warnings (too-many-locals, line-too-long, too-many-arguments) are accepted. Real issues (unused imports, actual bugs, f-strings without placeholders) are not.
- **[pyflakes](https://github.com/PyCQA/pyflakes)** — fast, zero-config, no false positives. Must be clean.
- **[radon](https://radon.readthedocs.io/)** — cyclomatic complexity. Target: no function rated D or worse. C-rated functions are tolerated. Current worst offenders: `convert` (18), `_register_extensions` (17), and `_load_extensions` (16) in h2c-core, all C.

### Pylint

| Repo | Score | Notes |
|------|-------|-------|
| h2c-manager | 9.90/10 | Style only (too-many-locals) |
| h2c-transform-flatten-internal-urls | 9.85/10 | Style only |
| h2c-provider-keycloak | 9.75/10 | Style + expected `import-error` (helmfile2compose not in path) |
| h2c-core | 9.70/10 | Style only (too-many-args on converter internals) |
| h2c-converter-cert-manager | 9.45/10 | Style + expected `import-error` |
| h2c-provider-servicemonitor | 9.35/10 | Style + expected `import-error` |
| h2c-converter-trust-manager | 9.18/10 | Style + expected `import-error` |
| h2c-rewriter-nginx | 8.50/10 | Style + expected `import-error` (helmfile2compose not in path) |
| h2c-rewriter-traefik | 7.33/10 | Style + expected `import-error` |

The `E0401: Unable to import 'helmfile2compose'` on extensions is expected — they import from h2c-core at runtime, not at lint time. The `R0903: Too few public methods` on converter classes is by design — the contract is one class, one method, that's it.

### Pyflakes

Zero warnings across all repos. We don't know how. We don't ask.

h2c-core MI is 0.00. MI is the only metric that sees through the cloud of desecration — alas, it is for the wrong reasons. Radon penalizes file size and volume of code heavily, so an 1800-line single-file converter with 50+ functions will bottom out regardless of internal structure. It condemned the temple not for the rituals performed within, but for the square footage.

## The uncomfortable truth

This project is, by every objective metric, well-structured code. The functions are short. The concerns are separated. The naming is consistent. The linters approve.

This is deeply unsettling.

The expectation — the *hope*, even — was that a tool this conceptually wrong would at least have the decency to be poorly written. That the code quality would serve as a warning label: "abandon all hope, ye who read this." Instead, the temple stands. The prayers work. The linters nod approvingly. And somewhere, a developer who understands what this project actually *does* stares at a pylint score of 9.70 and feels nothing but existential dread.

The code is clean. The architecture is sound. The concept remains an abomination. These things are not in conflict — they are in conspiracy.

## And then it got tests

IT HAS TESTS. IT HAS A TEST SUITE.

A [regression test suite](testing.md) that downloads two versions of h2c-core, runs every extension combo against a battery of edge-case manifests, and diffs the output. A torture test generator that produces O(n³) manifests. It cleans up after itself. It passes shellcheck.

A project that emulates a container orchestrator by flattening its output into a different container orchestrator, whose fake kube-apiserver lives on a personal GitHub account for plausible deniability — this project has automated regression testing. With CI. Weekly runs. Artifact uploads.

The linters approved. The complexity metrics nodded. And now the test suite confirms: the rituals produce identical output every time. The temple is no longer merely structurally sound — it is *under continuous inspection*.

## Running locally

```bash
# From any repo root
pylint <script>.py
pyflakes <script>.py
radon cc <script>.py -a -s -n C
```

For h2c-core specifically, the CLAUDE.md in the repo root documents the complexity targets and lint workflow.
