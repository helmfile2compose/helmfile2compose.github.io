# Roadmap

Ideas that are too good (or too cursed) to forget but not urgent enough to implement now.

For the emulation boundary — what can cross the bridge and what can't — see [Concepts](developer/concepts.md#the-emulation-boundary).


## Next

### Everything becomes an extension

Today, ConfigMap, Secret, Service, and PVC processing is hardcoded in the core. It works, but it means you can't swap out how any of these are handled without forking the script. The goal: make every kind dispatched through the same extension interface. Want to handle ConfigMaps differently? Write a ConfigMap extension. Want to add a custom Secret resolver? Drop it in `extensions/`.

The Kubernetes [Gateway API](https://gateway-api.sigs.k8s.io/) is the eventual successor to Ingress — `HTTPRoute`, `Gateway`, `GRPCRoute` instead of `Ingress`. A `GatewayRewriter` extension would handle these kinds the same way `IngressRewriter` handles Ingress annotations: read the Gateway API resources, produce Caddy config. No rush — Gateway API adoption is still ramping up — but the extension system should be ready for it when it comes.

### Shrink the core

The base objects (ConfigMap, Secret, Service, PVC) stay in the core — they're needed for any cluster. What should move out: optional convenience features that aren't required for a minimal conversion. Fix-permissions init containers, vendor-specific Ingress annotation rewriting, and similar opinionated logic are all candidates for extraction into extensions. Smaller core = less tentacles at your door.

First candidate: `_generate_fix_permissions` — self-contained ~30 lines that generates a busybox service for non-root containers with PVC bind mounts. Niche use case, good fit for a transform extension.

### Pipeline hooks

Named pipeline hooks (`post_aliases`, `pre_write`, etc.) for extensions. Not needed yet — converters + transforms cover known cases. Revisit if a third pattern shows up.

### Extension compatibility matrix

Extension manifests with `core_version_min` / `core_version_max_tested`. Manager warns/errors on mismatch. Today only extension-vs-extension incompatibility is checked — extension-vs-core version compat is not.

### Decentralized dependency resolution

Today, extension metadata (repo, file, depends) lives in a central `extensions.json` in h2c-manager. That works for a handful of extensions but won't scale. The plan: each extension repo declares its own dependencies (and optional dependencies) in a manifest file at its root (e.g. `h2c-extension.json`). h2c-manager fetches the manifest from the repo directly instead of consulting a central registry. `extensions.json` becomes a lightweight index (name → repo) or goes away entirely. A single sacred text that all disciples must consult before summoning — the hubris writes itself.

### More extensions

New CRD extensions (providers and converters) and transforms as needed. The extension system exists — writing a new one is straightforward (see [Writing converters](developer/extensions/writing-converters.md) and [Writing transforms](developer/extensions/writing-transforms.md)).

## v3.0 — contract split

Today, converters and providers share one contract: `kinds` + `convert()` → `ConvertResult`, and a `ConvertResult` can contain services, synthetic resources, or both. The distinction between converters (`h2c-converter-*`, resources only) and providers (`h2c-provider-*`, compose services) is a naming convention — nothing in the code enforces it.

The plan for v3.0: formalize the distinction. A converter returning `services` in its `ConvertResult` will first emit a deprecation warning, then fail in a later release. The exact mechanism (a class attribute, a separate base class, a manifest declaration) is TBD.

This requires h2c-manager to handle core version compatibility first — extension manifests with `core_version_min` / `core_version_max_tested` (see [Extension compatibility matrix](#extension-compatibility-matrix) above). Without that, there's no way to migrate extensions gracefully. Alternatively, if h2c moves to pip packaging before then, the standard Python dependency machinery handles this for free — and avoids reinventing the wheel.

## Out of scope

CronJobs, resource limits, HPA, PDB, probes-to-healthcheck. See [Limitations](limitations.md) for the full list and rationale.
