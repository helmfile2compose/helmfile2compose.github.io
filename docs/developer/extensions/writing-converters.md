# Writing converters

A converter is an extension that teaches h2c how to handle specific Kubernetes resource kinds. Each converter is a single `.py` file with a converter class.

If your converter targets CRD kinds (replacing a K8s controller), see [CRD patterns](writing-crd-patterns.md) for additional patterns (synthetic resources, network alias registration, cross-converter dependencies). For Ingress-specific reverse proxy backends, see [Writing ingress providers](writing-ingressproviders.md).

Note: the distinction between converters (`h2c-converter-*`) and providers (`h2c-provider-*`) is enforced — `Provider` is a base class in `h2c.pacts.types`. Providers produce compose services; converters produce synthetic resources. Both use `ConvertResult`, but subclassing `Provider` signals your intent to the framework.

## The contract

A converter class must have:

1. **`kinds`** — a list of K8s kinds to handle (e.g. `["Keycloak", "KeycloakRealmImport"]`). **Kinds are exclusive between extensions** — if two extensions claim the same kind, h2c exits with an error. An extension *can* override a built-in converter by claiming the same kind — the built-in is silently removed from the dispatch for that kind. Yes, this means you can replace how h2c handles Secrets, or Deployments. Why you would corrupt the already corrupted is between you and Yog Sa'rath. (For Ingress annotation handling, use an [ingress rewriter](writing-rewriters.md) instead — converters handle the kind dispatch, rewriters handle the annotation translation.)
2. **`convert(kind, manifests, ctx)`** — called once per kind, returns a `ConvertResult`

```python
from h2c import ConvertResult

class MyConverter:
    kinds = ["MyCustomResource"]

    def convert(self, kind, manifests, ctx):
        services = {}
        for m in manifests:
            name = m.get("metadata", {}).get("name", "?")
            spec = m.get("spec", {})
            services[name] = {
                "image": spec.get("image", "mydefault:latest"),
                "restart": "always",
                "environment": {"MY_VAR": spec.get("myField", "default")},
            }
        return ConvertResult(services=services)
```

### `ConvertResult`

A dataclass with two fields:

- **`services`** — `dict[str, dict]`: compose service definitions to add. Keyed by service name.
- **`caddy_entries`** — `list[dict]`: Caddy reverse proxy entries. Each entry has `host`, `path`, `upstream`, `scheme`, and optional `server_ca_secret`, `server_sni`, `strip_prefix`, `extra_directives`. Ingress rewriters are the primary producers of caddy_entries; converters rarely need to produce them directly.

Both default to empty. Most converters only produce `services`.

### `ConvertContext` (`ctx`)

The conversion context passed to every converter. Key attributes:

| Attribute | Type | Description |
|-----------|------|-------------|
| `ctx.configmaps` | `dict` | Indexed ConfigMaps (name -> manifest). **Writable** — converters can inject synthetic ConfigMaps (see [CRD patterns](writing-crd-patterns.md)). |
| `ctx.secrets` | `dict` | Indexed Secrets (name -> manifest). **Writable** — converters can inject synthetic secrets (see [CRD patterns](writing-crd-patterns.md)). |
| `ctx.config` | `dict` | The `helmfile2compose.yaml` config |
| `ctx.output_dir` | `str` | Output directory for generated files |
| `ctx.warnings` | `list[str]` | Append warnings here (printed to stderr) |
| `ctx.generated_cms` | `set[str]` | Names of ConfigMaps already written to disk |
| `ctx.generated_secrets` | `set[str]` | Names of Secrets already written to disk |
| `ctx.replacements` | `list[dict]` | User-defined string replacements |
| `ctx.alias_map` | `dict` | Service alias map (K8s Service name -> workload name) |
| `ctx.service_port_map` | `dict` | Service port map ((svc_name, port) -> container_port) |
| `ctx.fix_permissions` | `dict[str, int]` | Map of volume path -> UID. Entries generate a `fix-permissions` service that runs `chown -R <uid>` on the path. **Writable** — converters can register paths for non-root containers with bind mounts. |
| `ctx.services_by_selector` | `dict` | Index of K8s Services by name. Each entry has `name`, `namespace`, `selector`, `type`, `ports`. Used to resolve Services to compose names, generate network aliases, and build port maps. **Writable** — converters should register runtime-created Services here. |
| `ctx.pvc_names` | `set[str]` | Names of PersistentVolumeClaims discovered in manifests. Used to distinguish PVC mounts from other volume types during conversion. |
| `ctx.extension_config` | `dict` | Per-converter config section from `helmfile2compose.yaml`. Set automatically before each `convert()` call, keyed by the converter's `name` attribute (e.g. `caddy` → `extensions.caddy` in config). Empty dict if not configured. |

### Priority

Set `priority` as a class attribute to control execution order. Lower = earlier. Default: 100.

```python
class CertManagerConverter:
    kinds = ["Certificate", "ClusterIssuer", "Issuer"]
    priority = 10  # runs first
```

This matters when converters depend on each other's output (e.g. trust-manager needs cert-manager's generated secrets).

### Multi-kind dispatch

If your converter handles multiple kinds and needs to process them in order, use the `kind` argument. `convert()` is called once per kind, in the order they appear in the `kinds` list:

```python
class MyConverter:
    kinds = ["DependencyKind", "MainKind"]  # order = call order

    def __init__(self):
        self._indexed = {}

    def convert(self, kind, manifests, ctx):
        if kind == "DependencyKind":
            # Index first, produce nothing yet
            for m in manifests:
                name = m.get("metadata", {}).get("name", "")
                self._indexed[name] = m.get("spec", {})
            return ConvertResult()
        # kind == "MainKind" — use indexed data
        return self._process_main(manifests, ctx)
```
