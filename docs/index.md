# helmfile2compose

*For when you just wanted to maintain a nice helmfile but people kept asking for a docker-compose — then it got REALLY out of hand*

A set of tools that convert Kubernetes manifests to `compose.yml` + `Caddyfile`. Not Kubernetes-in-Docker (kind, k3d, minikube...) — no cluster, no kubelet, no shim. A devolution of the power of Kubernetes into the simplicity of compose: real `docker compose up`, real Caddy, plain stupid containers. What started as a single Python script is now a bare engine, a distribution, a package manager, an extension system, a regression suite, and a fake kube-apiserver. The scope creep was not planned. The scope creep was never planned.

Here because this upmost abomination is causing issues? Here's the path to (partial) redemption: **[Troubleshooting](troubleshooting.md)**.

## But why?

There are dozens of tools that go from Compose to Kubernetes ([Kompose](https://github.com/kubernetes/kompose), [Compose Bridge](https://docs.docker.com/compose/bridge/), [Move2Kube](https://move2kube.konveyor.io/), etc.) — that's the "normal" direction. Almost nothing goes the other way, because who would design their deployment in K8s first and then downgrade?

Using Kubernetes manifests as an intermediate representation to generate a docker-compose is absolutely using an ICBM to kill flies — which is exactly why I find it satisfying.

The name is `helmfile2compose` because both helmfilLe and docker-compose share the same purpose: deploying an entire self-contained platform at once. If you're using this to convert something that isn't self-contained, you are further into the abyss than I ever ventured, and I am certain it will end terribly. Yog Sa'rath, stay away from me.

## How it works

The same Helm charts used for Kubernetes are rendered into standard K8s manifests, then converted to compose:

```
Helm charts (helmfile / helm / kustomize)
    ↓  helmfile template / helm template / kustomize build
K8s manifests (Deployments, Services, ConfigMaps, Secrets, Ingress...)
    ↓  helmfile2compose.py
compose.yml + Caddyfile + configmaps/ + secrets/
```

Despite the name, **helmfile is not required** — the core accepts any directory of K8s YAML files. Helmfile is just one way to produce them.

### The ecosystem

What started as a single script became an ecosystem of four components:

- **[h2c-core](https://github.com/helmfile2compose/h2c-core)** — *the bare engine.* The conversion pipeline, extension loader, and CLI — with empty registries. No built-in converters, no opinions. A temple with no priests. Produces `h2c.py` (~1265 lines).
- **[helmfile2compose](https://github.com/helmfile2compose/helmfile2compose)** — *the distribution.* h2c-core + 7 built-in extensions (workloads, indexers, HAProxy rewriter, Caddy provider), concatenated into a single `helmfile2compose.py` (~1672 lines). This is what users run. See [Distributions](developer/distributions.md).
- **[Extensions](catalogue.md)** — *the damned.* External modules that teach h2c new tricks. Providers, converters, indexers, transforms, ingress rewriters, ingress providers — each a single `.py` file. For the glory of Yog Sa'rath.
- **[h2c-manager](https://github.com/helmfile2compose/h2c-manager)** — *the dark priest.* Downloads the distribution and extensions from GitHub releases, resolves dependencies, and provides a `run` shortcut. Reads `helmfile2compose.yaml` for declarative dependency management. Stdlib only, no dependencies.
